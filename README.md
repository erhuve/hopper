# Hopper
A bunnylol clone made in Rust
I will be customizing this more to my personal use, and maybe for others too, or I already have and didn't update the README. I probably will though.

## Current commands
- `tw` goes to Twitter
    - `tw @<handle>` goes to the profile of `@<handle>` 
    - `tw <search>` searches `<search>` on Twitter
- `gh` goes to Github
    - `gh <search>` goes to the given profile or repo in `<search>` (e.g. `erhuve` or `erhuve/hopper`)
- `osu <profile>` goes to the given `<profile>` on the osu! game website

## Plans
There's only so many websites I visit, so I honestly don't actually see many more commands to add for myself, though I will add them as I see fit. What I would like to do, however, is turn the index page into a form which one can create an account and log in with, and then add their own commands. 

So when the site is deployed, if you visit it, you can log in. The website will give instructions for adding it as a search engine in your browser. Then it will also have a form, where you can input a command you want to create, what arguments you will let it take in, and what URL bases to use for them.

That'd be cool. Maybe I'll do it.
